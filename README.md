# GITBIZ

## Introduction

This is a wee front end project written in React, which I started as part of my [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/) developer bootcamp. 

The basic idea is that a digital coding-centred business card is created from public information on your GitHub profile.  

## Work in progress

The functionality is largely complete, but is currently lacking a suitable, responsive and accessible design. This is will be finished and hosted imminently.
